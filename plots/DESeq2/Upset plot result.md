# UPSET PLOT INTERPRETATION
* Set size = frequency count of genes across all experimental conditions
* Intersection size = quantifying the combination of experimental conditions that make up each cluster

## Upregulated
* the lowest amount of upregulated gene sets were present in low nitrogen condition = least common
* Only 3 genes are shared across upregulated genes in the three conditions, indicating that the vast majority of genes are not shared and that rice uses different mechanisms under different conditions

## Downregulated
* There are a lot of downregulated gene sets in both low and gradient conditions
* Total is slightly more than upregulated, 12 genes in total
