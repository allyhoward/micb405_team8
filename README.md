Nitrogen fertilisation of Oryza sativa is used to boost plant growth in rice paddies, but may also contribute to the methane efflux by methanogens growing in these same paddies, thus contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that fuel global climate change. This study examines the ability of rice to uptake carbon through photosynthesis and act as a carbon sink to offset these GHG emissions. Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 was performed on the original data set from Subudhi et al. to compare rice plants grown at 4 ppm of nitrogen (unfertilised) and 40 ppm of nitrogen (fertilised). Further analysis of Gene Ontology was completed to categorise the overall trends in differential abundance between metabolic pathways. Our results found that certain genes involved in carbon cycling were differentially expressed in rice plants grown in the 40 ppm nitrogen conditions, leading to an overall increase in carbon uptake.
